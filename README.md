# Getting_and_cleaning_data

This is the Peer-reviewed project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course. The run_analysis R Skript, does the following:

    - downloads the dataset from the website and extracts the Zip file
    - loads the activity and feature information
    - loads the training and test data sets
    - selects only those columns which possess the mean or standard deviation
    - loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
    - merges the two data sets
    - creates the tidy_data_set 

The result has been submitted in the tidy_data_set text file.
